My Submission to the HytaleModding Modjam 
This mod adds a new golem mini-boss. To spawn it you need to place the golem build kit, which eventually should spawn in prefabs. You then charge the build kit with ancienct energy. This will awaken the golem mini-boss, which is a lot stronger and more agressive than his fellow golems. 
The awakened golem also has a trusty drone which gives him air support and needs to be taken down if you want to stand a chance.
Killing the mini-boss rewards you with the electric fists which apply electricity and also heal you a small amount.

I did this as a solo developer with the asset editor only and since I dont have much knowledge in designing and modelling, most assets are just recolors of exisiting assets.
